# Project: WomenTechWomenYes Gala
*Exploratory Data Analysis* on the **New York City MTA**(Metropolitan Transportation Authority) **Turnstile Data** and **New York City Census Data** <br/>

Hello everyone. In this repository, I share with you the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that I have done with my teammates on the New York City MTA Turnstile Data and New York City Census Data for the annual gala of the WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) organization, the first project of the Data Science Bootcamp, which I really enjoyed being in, of the [Istanbul Data Science Academy](https://istdatascience.com) with the contributions of [Hepsiburada](https://www.hepsiburada.com).



## Information

As the name suggests, the WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) organization aims to organize a gala and raise donations in New York City at the beginning of the summer in order to increase the effectiveness and competences of women in technology.

## Problem Statement

WTWY Organization aims to place its street crews at the entrances of subway stations in New York City and distribute tickets for the gala to the people passing by. Thus, the main goal is to distribute a lot of tickets and to distribute tickets to people who have the potential to donate to the organization at the gala. <br/>

For that, we used MTA Turnstile Data, because they want to know the busiest day and time slot of the busiest station to deploy their street crews. In addition, we also used New York City Census Data, because we thought that women might be more prone to collect donations for this organization, which aims to increase the effectiveness of women in technology, and we wanted to concentrate on boroughs with a higher women population in New York City. Apart from this, since the main purpose is to collect donations, we wanted to identify the boroughs with the highest average per capita income in New York City.
